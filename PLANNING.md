# Reddit Tech News AI Agent - Project Planning

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an AI agent that crawls Reddit for the latest technology news and generates concise, informative summaries. The agent will utilize Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) with Python and leverage the Gemini 1.5 model for generating high-quality summaries of tech-related posts.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)**: A Python-based toolkit for building and deploying AI agents with built-in Development UI
- **Gemini 1.5**: Google's advanced language model for generating high-quality summaries
- **Flask**: Web framework for creating the API endpoints
- **uv**: Modern Python package manager for dependency management
- **PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)**: Official Python library for accessing Reddit's API

### Additional Components
- **FastAPI** (alternative): May be considered as a more modern, async-friendly alternative to Flask
- **Redis**: For caching responses and managing rate limits
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: For storing crawled data and summaries
- **Background Task Processor**: For scheduling crawls and processing data asynchronously

### Agent Workflow
1. **Crawling Phase**:
   - Regularly fetch latest posts from technology-focused subreddits
   - Filter posts based on popularity, recency, and relevance
   - Store raw post data in the database

2. **Summarization Phase**:
   - Process crawled posts through Gemini 1.5 model
   - Generate concise summaries focusing on key technical details
   - Categorize summaries by technology domain (AI, web dev, hardware, etc.)

3. **Serving Phase**:
   - Expose summarized content through Flask API endpoints
   - Provide filtering and search capabilities
   - Implement user feedback mechanism for summary quality

## Key Features

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Reddit crawler focused on r/technology, r/programming, r/MachineLearning, and other tech subreddits
- Daily scheduled crawls to fetch the latest posts
- Gemini 1.5-powered summarization engine
- Basic Flask API with endpoints for retrieving summaries
- Leverage ADK's built-in Development UI for agent interaction and debugging
- Simple web portal for viewing summaries

### Future Enhancements
- User personalization (preferences for specific tech topics)
- Sentiment analysis of tech discussions
- Trend detection and analysis across tech subreddits
- Email digest for periodic updates
- Integration with other news sources beyond Reddit

## Technical Considerations

### Reddit API Limitations
- Respect Reddit's rate limits (60 requests per minute)
- Use authenticated API access via PRAW
- Implement caching to reduce API calls
- Handle Reddit API's pagination for complete data collection

### Google ADK Integration
- Configure ADK with appropriate Gemini model access
- Implement modular agent design with specialized tools
- Use ADK's session management and memory features
- Leverage ADK's built-in Development UI for testing and debugging
- Utilize ADK's built-in evaluation tools for summary quality

### Performance Optimization
- Implement background tasks for crawling and summarization
- Cache frequently accessed summaries
- Use database indexing for faster retrieval
- Consider implementing a content delivery strategy for global users

### Security Concerns
- Secure API key storage for Reddit and Gemini
- Implement rate limiting for the Flask API
- Handle user data in compliance with privacy regulations
- Implement proper authentication for admin functions

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Set up project structure and dependencies
- Implement Reddit crawler with PRAW
- Create database schema and ORM models
- Configure Google ADK with Gemini model

### Phase 2: Summarization Logic
- Develop prompt engineering for effective summarization
- Implement Gemini 1.5 integration through ADK
- Create summary validation and quality control mechanisms
- Build categorization logic for different tech domains

### Phase 3: Web API & Integration
- Develop Flask API endpoints for data access
- Configure ADK's Development UI for agent interaction
- Create a simple web portal that integrates with ADK's UI
- Implement search and filtering capabilities
- Add user feedback mechanisms

### Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring
- Set up monitoring and logging
- Configure CI/CD pipeline
