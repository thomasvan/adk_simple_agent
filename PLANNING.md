# Reddit Tech News AI Agent - Project Planning

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an AI agent that crawls Reddit for the latest technology news and generates concise, informative summaries. The agent will utilize Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) with Python and leverage the Gemini 1.5 model for generating high-quality summaries of tech-related posts.

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Google ADK (Agent Development Kit)**: A Python-based toolkit for building and deploying AI agents with built-in Development UI and FastAPI server
- **Gemini 1.5**: Google's advanced language model for generating high-quality summaries
- **uv**: Modern Python package manager for dependency management
- **PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper)**: Official Python library for accessing Reddit's API

### Additional Components
- **Redis**: For caching responses and managing rate limits
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: For storing crawled data and summaries
- **Background Task Processor**: For scheduling crawls and processing data asynchronously

## Architecture

### Agent Workflow
1. **Crawling Phase**:
   - Regularly fetch latest posts from technology-focused subreddits
   - Filter posts based on popularity, recency, and relevance
   - Store raw post data in the database

2. **Summarization Phase**:
   - Process crawled posts through Gemini 1.5 model
   - Generate concise summaries focusing on key technical details
   - Categorize summaries by technology domain (AI, web dev, hardware, etc.)

3. **Serving Phase**:
   - Expose summarized content through Flask API endpoints
   - Provide filtering and search capabilities
   - Implement user feedback mechanism for summary quality

## Key Features

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Reddit crawler focused on r/technology, r/programming, r/MachineLearning, and other tech subreddits
- Daily scheduled crawls to fetch the latest posts
- Gemini 1.5-powered summarization engine
- Leverage ADK's built-in FastAPI server for API endpoints
- Utilize ADK's built-in Development UI for agent interaction and debugging
- Simple web portal for viewing summaries

### Future Enhancements
- User personalization (preferences for specific tech topics)
- Sentiment analysis of tech discussions
- Trend detection and analysis across tech subreddits
- Email digest for periodic updates
- Integration with other news sources beyond Reddit

## Technical Considerations

### Reddit API Limitations
- Respect Reddit's rate limits (60 requests per minute)
- Use authenticated API access via PRAW
- Implement caching to reduce API calls
- Handle Reddit API's pagination for complete data collection

### Google ADK Integration
- Configure ADK with appropriate Gemini model access
- Implement modular agent design with specialized tools
- Use ADK's session management and memory features
- Leverage ADK's built-in Development UI for testing and debugging
- Utilize ADK's built-in evaluation tools for summary quality

### Performance Optimization
- Implement background tasks for crawling and summarization
- Cache frequently accessed summaries
- Use database indexing for faster retrieval
- Consider implementing a content delivery strategy for global users

### Security Concerns
- Secure API key storage for Reddit and Gemini
- Implement rate limiting for the ADK FastAPI server
- Handle user data in compliance with privacy regulations
- Implement proper authentication for admin functions

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Minimal ADK Agent & UI Setup
- Set up core project structure (agent directory, main.py).
- Configure Google ADK and connect to Gemini 1.5 model.
- Implement a basic agent core capable of simple interaction.
- Start and test the ADK Development UI for basic agent chat.

### Phase 2: Mock Data Integration & Summarization
- Define mock Reddit post data structures.
- Develop prompt engineering for summarization using mock data.
- Integrate Gemini 1.5 for summarizing mock data.
- Display summarized mock data via the ADK Development UI.
- Add basic testing for summarization with mock data.

### Phase 3: Reddit Crawler & Database Implementation
- Implement Reddit crawler module using PRAW.
- Set up database schema (SQLite initially) and ORM models.
- Store real crawled data into the database.
- Integrate the crawler and database with the summarization agent.
- Add unit tests for crawler and database interactions.

### Phase 4: API, Enhancements & Deployment
- Configure ADK's built-in FastAPI server for data access endpoints.
- Develop search, filtering, and other API features.
- Create a simple web portal for viewing summaries.
- Implement comprehensive testing, monitoring, logging.
- Prepare for deployment (Docker, CI/CD).

## Technical Debt & Challenges
- Reddit's API changes may require adaptation
- Gemini model costs and quota management
- Handling large volumes of data efficiently
- Ensuring summary accuracy for technical content
